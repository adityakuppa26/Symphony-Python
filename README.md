# Symphony

Symphony turns project work into isolated, autonomous implementation runs, allowing teams to manage
work instead of supervising coding agents.

_In this [demo video](https://player.vimeo.com/video/1186371009?h=5626e4b899), Symphony monitors a Linear board for work and spawns agents to handle the tasks. The agents complete the tasks and provide proof of work: CI status, PR review feedback, complexity analysis, and walkthrough videos. When accepted, the agents land the PR safely. Engineers do not need to supervise Codex; they can manage the work at a higher level._

> [!WARNING]
> Symphony is a low-key engineering preview for testing in trusted environments.

# Symphony Jira Python MVP

It uses Jira REST credentials from `WORKFLOW.md`, prepares a per-issue local
workspace, runs the locally installed `codex` CLI with `codex exec --json`, stores
run data in SQLite, and posts Jira comments from the Python orchestrator.

It does not require `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `CODEX_API_KEY`. Codex authentication is
whatever the local `codex` CLI already uses.

## Commands
